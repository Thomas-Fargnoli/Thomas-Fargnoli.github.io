        <h1> Thomas's Final Project in CSC 106</h1>
        <p> This is my <em>Deal or No Deal</em> game designed in ProcessingJS. In this game you choose a case that you think has the million 
        dollars in it. You slowly eliminate all the other cases each round, with the case amount varying based on what round it is. At certain rounds throughout the game a banker will offer you money,
        that you can either take, ending the game and flashing the congratualtions screen, or refuse, continuing where you left off. Eventually you will reach the end, where there will be two cases left. You will be given the option to either
        eliminate your original chosen case or the remaining case. When one is selcted for elimination the game will end and you will be prompted with a congratulation and the dollar amount you won.
        <br>Our program is designed in a way to make each game
        unique, so the case amounts will be random everytime and so will the banker amounts. Each case is designed to hold a value and will be blacked out if selected. We made
        an interactive list on the left of the screen which will change based on what cases are and are not slected, allowing you to keep progress of the game as you go along.
        To use all these different features all you will need to do is click on the buttons prompted or the cases during the actualy rounds, I hope you throughly enjoy our game as it has a lot of passion that was put into it. </p>
