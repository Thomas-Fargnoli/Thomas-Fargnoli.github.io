        <h1>Who is Thomas Fargnoli?</h1>
         <p> My name is Thomas Fargnoli. I am a Freshman at The University of Rhode Island, majoring in Computer Science.
            I became interested in this topic when I was very young. I always wanted to program video games but did not know how to pursue it.
            After years of research I determined my best path was to pursue Computer Science.</p>
        <p>I am very active, I work out with my dumb bells every day before or after my daily classes. I play video games sometimes; however, when I have to
            work or do school work I barely touch them. Some of my favorite past times is watching youtube, where I frequent history based content.</p>
