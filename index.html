        <h1> Welcome to Thomas' New Website</h1>
            <p> Hello! My name is Thomas Fargnoli. I am a Computer Science Major at The University of Rhode Island.
                This website was created inorder to keep a portfolio of the programs that I have written for my CSC106 Computer programming class.
                I created this website using the programming language known as HTML. The Javascript section link is a list of Javascripts the I have written that
                can be embedded into web pages. The Apps section is full of the applications that I have programmed that run on phones.
